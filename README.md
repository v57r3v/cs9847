ECON GU 4251: Problem set 1 
Spring 2024Problem   sets are   graded (check/check   minus)   based   on   eﬀort, this includes   the formatting   of   your   work   (typesetting   is   strongly   encouraged). You   can   work   in   groups,   but   each   student   must   upload   an   individual   solution. Submissions need to be in pdf format   and   submitted   via   Canvas. We will not   accept   other   formats.
Demand and welfare analysis 
1.    Consider   a   market   with   two   goods   j   =   1,   2.      Good   j   =   1   consists   of   “green”    but   slow   vehicles,   while   j   = 2 corresponds to polluting yet fast vehicles.    There are four types of consumers, diﬀering   in   terms   of   their derived utilities from owning   a   vehicle.    A consumer   of type   t =   1,   2,   3,   4   has   preferences   described
by   the   pair Vt      = (V1(t),   V2(t)).    Consumers   of type   t choose j   =   1   if
V1(t)   -   p1 ≥ V2(t)   -   p2   ,          and   V1(t)   -   p1 ≥ 0;
they   choose   j   = 2   if
V2(t)   -   p2    ≥ V1(t)   -   p1   ,          and   V2(t)   -   p2    ≥   0;   and   they   choose   to   not   purchase   either   good   otherwise.
The   following   table   provides   values   of Vt    for   t =   1,   2,   3,   4   and   a   brief description   of the   consumers.Type (t) Description

a.    Brieﬂy    (max      four      sentences)      discuss   whether   the      interpretation/label      assigned   to      each   type      is   consistent   with   the   values   of Vt.
b.    Out   of   a   population   of   170   million,   there   are   30   million   type   1   individuals,   and   100   million   type
3   individuals.         You   learn   that,   when   the   prices   of   the   two   vehicles   are P =      (p1   ,   p2   )   =      (7, 15),   q1   (p1   ,   p2   ) =   130   million,   and   q2   (p1   ,   p2   ) =   25   million.
How   many   individuals   are   type   4,   and   how   many   individuals   are   type   2?
c.    Using   your   answer   in   point   b.   above,   and   holding   ﬁxedp2    =   15,   draw   q1   (p1, 15)   as   a   function   of   p1.
d.      What would be the eﬀecton   quantities   and   consumer   surplus   of an   increase   in   the   price   (e.g.    due   to   a   tax)   of   polluting   fast   vehicles   from P =   (p1   ,   p2   ) =   (7, 15) to      (7,   25)?
e.      What   would   be   the   eﬀecton   quantities   and   consumer   surplus   代 写Econ GU4251, Spring 2024 Problem set 1

f.    In less than 50 words, can   you   comment   on   how   would   you   choose   between   a   policy   (tax)   inducing   the   price   change   in   d.      and   a   policy   inducing   the   price   change   in   e.?
Multiproduct monopoly 
2.    Suppose   a   monopolist   Fp    in   the   burgers   market   produces   patties   (p)   at   zero   cost   and   the   demand   for   patties   is   given   by:
Qp      =   1 -   Pp   -   Pbwhere   Qp    is   the   quantity   of patties   demanded,   Pp    is   the   price   of patties,   and   Pb      is   the   price   of   buns,   which   are   available   to   consumers   through   a   diﬀerent   ﬁrm,   Fb   ,   at   a   price   of   Pb    =  .    The   demand   for   buns   if given   by:
Qp      =   1 - 3/1Pp   -   Pb Now   suppose   Fp    acquires   Fb    and   produces   both   patties   and   buns   at   zero   cost.    Will   this   acquisition   lead   to   an   increase   or   a   decrease   in   the   price   of patties?    Find   the   old   and   new   equilibrium   quantities   and   prices.
Price Discrimination 
3.    Suppose   there   are   two   groups   of consumers   potentially   served   by   a   monopolist,   one   with   high   income   and   one   with   low   income,   denoted   by   A   and   B   respectively.      Let   inverse   demand   function   for   group   A   be   PA      = 20 - QA   ,   and   for   group   B   be   PB      = 10 - 2QB   .
(a)    Find   the   demand   function   for   each   group.
(b)    Consider   the   case   in   which   the   monopolist   is   not   allowed   to   price   discriminate   and   it   charges   a   uniform. price.   Let its marginal cost   be   equal   to   zero.      Compute optimal   price,   quantity,   consumer   surplus,   proﬁts   and   social   welfare.
(c)    Suppose   now   the   monopolist   can   do   third-degree   price   discrimination   and   charge   diﬀerent   prices   to   each   group.      What   price   would   the   monopolist   charge   to   each   group?      Compute   optimal   price,   quantity,   consumer   surplus,   proﬁts   and   social   welfare.
(d)    Consider again the case in which the monopolist is   not   allowed   to   price   discriminate   and   it   charges   a uniform. price but the marginal cost is c = 8.   Would the monopolist serve both groups?    Compute   optimal   price,   quantity,   consumer   surplus,   proﬁts   and   social   welfare.
